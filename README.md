## Recommended Websites
- [Youtube] (https://www.youtube.com/) - I've grownup with Youtube for the over a decade. I think it's an amazing place to find out anything you want to learn about in video form.
- [InternetArchive] (https://archive.org/) - The Internet Archive is a great place to find so many things from all around the world and from different time periods, it's a website that stores paper and digital works throughout time.
